Sounds like a great starting point! The project aims to create a small data exchange program that utilizes 
UNIX signals, which is an excellent foundation for future projects in the course. By implementing this program, 
you'll gain a solid understanding of how to work with signals and how they can be used to communicate between different parts of a program,
setting the stage for more complex UNIX projects to come.
